I coded clone of the flappy bird. You can find game's code [HERE](https://github.com/mcagricaliskan/Youtube/tree/master/PyGame%20Uygulamal%C4%B1%20E%C4%9Fitim/Uygulama%202%20(%20Ders%208%20-%20)) at 14-.py

I had to code neural network from scratch. Because my computer not good enough for using library and creating bigger population.

I think code is fine not messy. I will add some comment lines later.

Sometimes I found best population so fast. I saw best generation on third generation.

just a sample here 16th generation
